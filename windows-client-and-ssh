Convert PEM Key to OpenSSH Format (Optional):
If your PEM key is not in OpenSSH format (the one that Windows typically uses), you might need to convert it. OpenSSH requires the private key to be in a specific format. You can use tools like PuTTYgen or the ssh-keygen command on Linux or macOS to perform the conversion.

Using PuTTYgen (if you have it installed):
Open PuTTYgen.
Click on the "Conversions" menu and select "Import key."
Choose your PEM private key file.
PuTTYgen will convert the key to OpenSSH format.
Save the converted key in a location of your choice (e.g., id_rsa and id_rsa.pub).
Import the Key to Windows:
Once you have the PEM key in OpenSSH format or if it was already in the correct format, you can import it into Windows:

Press the Windows key and type "Manage optional features." Open this system settings.
Scroll down and click on "OpenSSH Client," then click the "Install"

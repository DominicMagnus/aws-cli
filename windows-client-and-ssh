Convert PEM Key to OpenSSH Format (Optional):
If your PEM key is not in OpenSSH format (the one that Windows typically uses), you might need to convert it. OpenSSH requires the private key to be in a specific format. You can use tools like PuTTYgen or the ssh-keygen command on Linux or macOS to perform the conversion.

Using PuTTYgen (if you have it installed):
Open PuTTYgen.
Click on the "Conversions" menu and select "Import key."
Choose your PEM private key file.
PuTTYgen will convert the key to OpenSSH format.
Save the converted key in a location of your choice (e.g., id_rsa and id_rsa.pub).
Import the Key to Windows:
Once you have the PEM key in OpenSSH format or if it was already in the correct format, you can import it into Windows:



icacls id_rsa /inheritance:r /grant:r "%USERNAME%:R"

ssh-add C:\Users\user\key\id_rsa

ssh-agent -k  # Stop the SSH Agent
ssh-agent     # Start the SSH Agent
